# Infrastructure Engineer - Cloud Infrastructure

<div className="pill"> Full-Time, Oslo, Trondheim, Stockholm & Remote</div>

Working Group Two is on a mission to make mobile subscriptions much more useful and relevant by providing programmable mobile networks for everyone. The way we do this is to change the way traditional telco works and to deliver mobile core network services from the cloud. This includes building a platform for mobile operators, controlling our own technology, enabling rapid iterations and focusing on the end-user experience. 

We are looking for a cloud or infrastructure engineer with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure.   While many companies take infrastructure for granted, WG2 realizes that the infrastructure work we do is vital for our platform and is a big lever that enables security, speed, agility and scale in the other teams.  Because Working Group Two realizes that good infrastructure is a competitive advantage, we have the freedom to take a proactive approach and can plan longer-term and bigger tasks rather than only reacting to immediate needs.

This is a unique opportunity to help shape modern telecommunications.
