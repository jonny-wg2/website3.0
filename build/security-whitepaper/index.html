At all times, authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Third-party developers must adopt the oAuth authentication model to ensure data governance between the subscriber and developer.</p><p>All APIs undergo the same security controls listed in the previous section, Software Development. Additionally, the following security controls include:</p><ul><li>Rate limiting</li><li>Metrics and logging</li><li>Input validation</li><li>Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)</li><li>Penetration testing</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="cloud-security">Cloud Security<a class="hash-link" href="#cloud-security" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Working Group Two operates primarily within AWS Cloud. Best practices are adopted to ensure security controls, processes, and countermeasures are implemented to reduce their attack surface.</p><p>WG2 holds an <a href="https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0010h00001ZY6fDAAT/Working%20Group%20Two%20As" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Certified Partner</a> with AWS. In doing so, we have demonstrated the leading best practices for operating a reliable, scalable, and secure infrastructure in the cloud. For example, we have implemented policies to prevent publicly exposing data and built tools to identify exposed services and misconfigurations as it impacts the security of our products. WG2 has completed the AWS Well-Architected Best Practices assessment, which the report can be provided upon request.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="disaster-recovery-and-business-continuity-plan">Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#disaster-recovery-and-business-continuity-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>WG2 utilizes services deployed by our hosting provider to distribute production operations across multiple separate physical locations. These three locations are within one geographic region which protects WG2’s service from loss of connectivity, power infrastructure, and other common location-specific failures. WG2 retains a full backup copy of production data, in real-time. Backups are tested periodically.</p><p>In addition, several security controls are implemented across the cloud infrastructure include:</p><ul><li>A secure Identify and Access Management (IAM) is used to implement RBAC controls over cloud resources that meet legal requirements and least privileged access</li><li>MFA authentication is required for all access to cloud resources</li><li>API communication is over HTTPS/TLS</li><li>A zero-downtime deployment model architecture is adopted across the cloud service to operate across multiple availability zones and regions. In addition, failures are tested regularly as part of our backup and disaster recovery plan.</li><li>Communication workflows are organized with customers if downtime is expected within our cloud or applications</li><li>Cloud and application logs are ported to internal services for analysis, monitoring, and reporting. In addition, log events can be exported to customers.</li><li>Isolation mechanisms are created across cloud resources to ensure tenants are secured</li><li>Internal and external application penetration testing is performed on a regular basis</li><li>Detection mechanisms are implemented to identify abuse across telco and network services</li><li>There exists a business continuity plan for assessing and recovering from potential cloud-related incidents that can result in production downtime</li><li>Global policies to prevent misconfigurations of data stores.

To ensure security is implemented, we have adopted an onion-approach security model to implement security across multiple layers of the network. Depending on the application or service, security controls are aligned to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exposure to rogue devices, networks, and users.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="network-security-and-server-hardening">Network Security and Server Hardening<a class="hash-link" href="#network-security-and-server-hardening" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>WG2 divides its systems into separate networks to better protect sensitive data. Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting WG2’s production infrastructure. All servers within the development and production infrastructure are hardened (e.g., removing default passwords, disabling unnecessary ports, etc.) and have a base configuration image applied to ensure consistency across the environment. Automatic security updates are applied regularly.</p><p>A network-based intrusion detection system has been deployed across all environments to identify and alert on network anomalies such as data leakage (DLP), trojans, unauthorized access, backdoors, and brute-forcing. </p><p>A host-based intrusion detection system is deployed across all cluster resources to identify and alert on host-based network anomalies such as rogue system processes, bitcoin mining, log tampering, the launch of privileged shells, outbound connections to C2 servers, unexpected network traffic, and more. All findings generate metrics and alerts which will notify on-call engineers of such events.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="ddos">DDoS<a class="hash-link" href="#ddos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a known threat across WG2’s application and telco infrastructure. In response, WG2 has controls, metrics, and playbooks for reducing the risk of an event to ensure business and service continuity.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="wg2-edge-locations---ddos">WG2 Edge Locations - DDoS<a class="hash-link" href="#wg2-edge-locations---ddos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>WG2 has identified key controls through threat model sessions and best practices to reduce the risk from DDoS events. Today, on WG2 Edge Locations, there exist controls and procedures to drop traffic, capacity planning, metrics and alerting, and playbooks for mitigating such events. Playbooks are defined in correlation with upstream ISPs to blackhole malicious traffic before reaching our systems.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="cloud-infrastructure---ddos">Cloud Infrastructure - DDoS<a class="hash-link" href="#cloud-infrastructure---ddos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>WG2 leverages a multi-availability, immutable infrastructure design that allows us to scale our infrastructure and applications based on traffic patterns with little to no downtime. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="endpoint-security">Endpoint Security<a class="hash-link" href="#endpoint-security" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Encryption at rest is required for all endpoint hard drives. WG2 monitors all device OS versions for known vulnerabilities. Additionally, there exist procedures for remotely wiping company data on the phone if lost or stolen. </p><p>Additional security controls include:</p><ul><li>Firewall rules per service level (inbound, and depending on the service, also outbound)</li><li>Monitoring public endpoints and misconfigurations such as public data stores</li><li>Automatic security updates across all servers</li><li>Yearly 3rd party penetration test</li><li>Monitoring vulnerabilities across application services, OS, and applications</li><li>Threat modeling core services throughout the development lifecycle</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="data-security-and-encryption">Data Security and Encryption<a class="hash-link" href="#data-security-and-encryption" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Protecting customers’ data from unauthorized access is Working Group Two’s top priority. Several countermeasures exist to identify, contain, and prevent data leakage. Leveraging security as part of the design, encryption, access controls, and integrity controls, Working Group Two can protect customer data.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="encryption">Encryption<a class="hash-link" href="#encryption" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>WG2 leverages encryption at every level of our mobile core network to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of customer data. To ensure WG2 always protects  customer data and remains compliant with industry standards, we have implemented software-defined policies that automatically monitor and prevent misconfigurations. For example, it is impossible to deploy a new database resource without encryption enabled as this will be prevented at run-time by these policies.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="encryption-in-transit">Encryption in Transit<a class="hash-link" href="#encryption-in-transit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>All data transmitted between WG2 clients and its operators’ services (northbound interface, for e.g. BSS) is done using strong encryption protocols. WG2 supports the latest recommended secure cipher suites to encrypt all external traffic in transit, including TLSv1.2 protocols, IPsec with AES128 encryption, and ECDHE ciphers.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="encryption-at-rest">Encryption at Rest<a class="hash-link" href="#encryption-at-rest" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>WG2 enforces encryption-at-rest policies for deployed cloud resources. This includes AWS EBS, S3, RDS, ElasticCache, SQS, and ElasticSearch. Encryption keys for AuC/AUSF (for SIM secrets) are FIPS 140-2 validated, auto-rotated, and backed by an HSM. In addition, various core services such as SMS and HLR/HSS perform additional encryption of sensitive data within the application. WG2 also has further mechanisms and policies for secure key management such as least-privilege RBAC with audit alerting. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="gdpr">GDPR<a class="hash-link" href="#gdpr" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>WG2 is the Data-Processor of all data and provides the ability for operators to have full control of their end-user data. The Data-Controller sets the data retention policy and processing agreement outlined in the Data Processing Agreement (DPA). This ensures that the customer has control over how long the data is stored, where the data is stored, and who has access to the data.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="data-availability">Data Availability<a class="hash-link" href="#data-availability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Leveraging remote backups, WG2 can ensure that data is not lost, compromised, or permanently deleted in an event.</p><p>Additional security controls: </p><ul><li>Non-production test data, keeping production data untouched in a development zone</li><li>RBAC controls restrict who has access to personal data</li><li>Privacy and security training for all employees</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="identity-and-access-management">Identity and Access Management<a class="hash-link" href="#identity-and-access-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Least-privilege, need-to-know basis, RBAC, centralized IAM, and individual accounts are just a few of the controls Working Group Two has in place to monitor and secure our core platform. </p><p>Additional controls include:</p><ul><li>Centralized policies across accounts, cloud, and application resources restricting access</li><li>Individual accounts</li><li>External audit logging stored for 3 years</li><li>Alerting when a high privileged account is used, and access to remote systems</li><li>Strict password policy at least 12 characters with a combination of uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character</li><li>Secure remote access using encryption protocols</li><li>Procedures for offboarding employees across systems</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="logging-and-monitoring">Logging and Monitoring<a class="hash-link" href="#logging-and-monitoring" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A centralized logging and monitoring system allows Working Group Two to ensure business continuity and security with the ability to alert and investigate security incidents.
