        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>PRESS RELEASE</h2><img src="/img/ckh.png" alt="ckh" width="300"/><ul><li>As an industry-first, CKH IOD migrates its core network to the cloud – delivered as a fully managed software-as-a-service by Working Group Two and deployed on AWS</li><li>A cloud-based core network brings radical simplification, cost efficiency and a platform to leverage a developer community – to drive innovation and capitalize on disruptive technologies</li></ul><p><strong>Oslo/London, 1 December, 2021</strong> – CKH Innovations Opportunities Development (CKH IOD) has entered into a contract with Working Group Two to move its core network to the public cloud. CKH IOD, a telecoms unit and international development hub of CK Hutchison, via a fully managed SaaS by Working Group Two, will deploy its mobile core network on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The agreement means that CKH IOD, and its MVNO, IoT and Private Network customers, can achieve radical simplification, speed up innovation, explore new revenue streams and get to market faster.</p><p>CKH IOD will leverage Working Group Two’s platform to deliver services across the CK Hutchison telecoms footprint in Europe, Asia and its wider international partners.</p><p>By evolving to a software-defined network, CKH IOD radically consolidates its vendor relationships and associated complexities. Working Group Two’s fully managed mobile core network also automates operations and maintenance to deliver a more cost-efficient service.</p><p>“Our collaboration with Working Group Two to deploy our core network on the public cloud delivers simplicity, improved operational efficiency and the ability to quickly develop new initiatives to meet market needs, with particular focus on the MVNO, IoT and Private Network space. It’s about achieving scale and the highest levels of security while reducing complexity – to the benefit of our customers and ultimately, end-users in our markets,” says Joe Parker, CEO of CKH IOD.</p><p>“CKH IOD earns a first-mover advantage by deploying a core built leveraging the webscale playbook. Being built on the cloud and delivered as-a-service, this core enables simplicity, cost efficiency and a continuous evolution of capabilities and features – with no end-of-life. In addition, they get access to a community of partners that build and integrate into the cloud core, giving a vastly enhanced pace of innovation. Under the umbrella of “everything as-a-service” the time has come to include the core network. We are incredibly excited to announce this landmark agreement,” says Erlend Prestgard, CEO of Working Group Two.</p><p>Working Group Two leverages the proven infrastructure and breadth of services from AWS to deploy a cloud-native core network.</p><p>“Working Group Two is a pioneer in building mobile core networks with much of the same philosophy that AWS builds infrastructure. Scalable, secure, consistent and API-driven, delivering the promise of efficiency and rapid innovation at scale,” says David Brown, VP and GM of Amazon EC2.</p><p>“With CKH IOD deciding to host its core network on the public cloud and have it fully managed by a third party under a managed SaaS model, we are witnessing a significant technology shift. By opting for a full set of capabilities from AWS, CKH IOD and Working Group Two can leverage the full benefits of the public cloud, including opening up for new business models. This will allow CKH IOD to scale their services and offerings with superior visibility and control. They will be stimulating a rapid pace of innovation with the highest levels of security and performance,” says Fabio Cerone, Managing Director EMEA, Telco Business Unit at AWS.</p><h3>About CKH Innovations Opportunities Development</h3><p>CKH Innovations Opportunities Development is a telecom unit and international development hub of CK Hutchison, creating international and global technological innovations that are built on one of CK Hutchison’s strongest assets, our mobile networks.
